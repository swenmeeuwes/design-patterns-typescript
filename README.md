Design patterns in TypeScript.

## Installing dependencies - Always run first!
`npm install`

## Transpiling
Transpiles TypeScript files in 'src' to JavaScript files in 'build'.
The 'build' folder will be created if it doesn't exist.

Transpiling TypeScript to JavaScript:

`npm compile`

## Playground
The 'main.ts' file acts as an entry point for the 'playground'.
Here you can play around with the design patterns.

Running the playground:

`npm run playground`
